# ABSTRACT
This project introduces an inventive application of neural networks in cricket sports video-to-text summarization, focusing on the extraction and representation of key highlights and events. The proposed system aims to transform the traditional approach to summarizing cricket match videos by harnessing the power of neural network architectures, including VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). By converting visual cues into concise textual summaries, the system offers an efficient solution for summarization, enhancing accessibility for a diverse audience. This innovative approach not only caters to cricket enthusiasts but also presents an invaluable tool for coaches, analysts, and sports professionals. The system's ability to distill complex match details into easily digestible textual summaries offer a streamlined approach to glean insights, strategize, and review match performances effectively. The integration of neural networks adds a layer of sophistication to the summarization process, offering a
unique perspective on information extraction from cricket sports videos. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to a new era of accessible and streamlined content  consumption, free from the complexities of in-depth sports.

# HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROJECT:

allmodules.py file consists of all the code to generate the summary of input cricket video 

1. Run app.py (flask program)
2. It renders index.html
3. Click the Upload button to upload a cricket video as input
4. Then click the Submit button to process the summary for the input video
5. After the processing, click the Generate button to get the textual summary of the uploaded video
